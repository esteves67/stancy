### Server and client

Easily serve content from static folders and files, and fetch content.

### Plural Folders

Stancy intelligently works out what are collections and what are items. Using a plural sounding folder creates a collection.

### Index File

Use an index file inside a folder to create an item and a collection. The files contained inside that folder become children of that item. This is useful if you prefer to organise using folders or if you want to create an index page for a group of related content.

### Hidden Files and Folders

Prepend an underscore `_` to hide a file or folder. In the case of hiding a folder, this will also hide all it's contents.
