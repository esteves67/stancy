## Index File

Placing an index file inside a folder will create an item. The files contained inside that folder become children of that item. This is useful if you prefer to organise using folders or if you want to create an index page for a group of related content.

```bash
# Creates a collection of items
collection/
item-one.md
item-two.md
item-three.md

# Creates an item
item/
index.md
```


## Hidden

Prepend an underscore to hide a file or folder. In the case of hiding a folder, this will also hide all it's contents.

```
_file-is-hidden.md
_folder-is-hidden/
```
